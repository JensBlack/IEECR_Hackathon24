# IEECR Hackathon 2024

## Welcome and Disclaimer


Welcome Hackathon Participants ðŸ‘‹,

In this hackathon, we will be working with the Titanic dataset ðŸš¢, a classic machine learning problem. The challenge is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features like age, gender, and ticket class.

#### The use of ChatGPT/Gemini/Copilot etc.

We are well aware that tools such as ChatGPT are very usefull in writing standardized code (aka. Boilerplate code) or suggesting interesting solutions to complex problems, incl. the implementation of machine learning models via scikit-learn.

While the use of these tools in scientific papers is a topic of current debate, we are here to learn something about how to implement machine learning models and **we strongly recommend to resist the little button, chatbox, or autocomplete features**.


## Getting started

To get started, follow these steps to open the notebook in Google Colab:

> There is a model solution in the notebook. We recommend that you try yourself first, before looking at the solution on how to implement ML models. If nothing helps, you are welcome to use the solution as a basis.

For those that are interested in a more complex challenge, the Caltech Mouse Social Behavior dataset is waiting here:

> Be aware, that this will take considerably more knowledge about data handling, feature engineering, and has been attempted by leading labs in the field but not solved 100%. That said, it is a great opportunity to try something more relevant and you are welcome to return to this repository whenever you want.

Happy problem solving!

## How to submit 

Solving a challenging problem is fun and you should celebrate each successful implementation, performance improvement, and *AHA!* moment.

For those that want a little more challenge, we have a leaderboard where you are welcome to submit your model's performance on the test set (last cell):

We will crown the winners at the end of the hackathon!
